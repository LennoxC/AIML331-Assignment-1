Kia Ora,
Lennox Crowe, crowelenn, 300607096 here.

I hope you can run this notebook without issue. I have kept the libraries I have used to a minimum, 
and they are defined in requirements.txt along with the version numbers that I used.

I have included some basic documentation in the markdown and the comments, but this is designed to support 
the PDF report attached with my submission.

Happy reading & running!

Lennox.
